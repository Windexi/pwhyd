# Progress Reports!
## A dedicated page for notices on important development updates.

## November 11th, 2018 // 7:38PM PST
I have some important news! You may have noticed, the commits lately have been a bit slow. Well, that's because I've been working on building a new computer! Right now, the PC I am using is an old laptop from 2012. It crashes often, and is really hard to work on. Luckily, I am making some significant headway in building a new one! Unfortunately, until I finish, I will be suspending development. The build should be done by Christmas, so it won't be that big of a halt.

TL;DR:
- PROS: Newer PC coming soon, meaning faster builds and more progress!
- CONS: Lack of commits until it is done.

Thanks for reading!

Hello again! It's time for another status update! For now, Cherrygrove City is also completed, and I have posted Alpha 0.2 over at the [dedicated Builds page.](https://github.com/Windexi/pwhyd/blob/master/BUILDS.md) I've slowly become more and more knowledgeable on Assembly scripting as I go on, and have mostly been working on ironing out the bugs I create with every new commit I push. I'm very excited to continue development on this hack though, and as of now have made some pretty substantial progress! Also, I made a [quick announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/9qb380/wip_pokemon_what_have_you_done/) on /r/pokemonromhacks about the project, so hopefully that will spark some interest! I know that it's made me very excited for what's to come. I have definitely altered the story from what it originally was set out to be, and I think it's definitely for the better. As I continue work, I keep coming up with awesome ideas for what I should do next. Stay tuned!

Kindest regards,

Well, I'm back! I hope you all had a wonderful summer, I know I did! I'm very exhausted from months of volunteerwork, but now should be able to kickstart the project once more. Updates will start rolling out soon. I opened up the .gbc to recheck my progress, and there was a bunch of stuff broken... yay. Looks like I have my work cut out for me!

See you soon!

Hello everyone. I have made some significant progress on Route 29 and some titlescreen FX for the project, but the time has come, and this will most likely be my last update for a while. Early in the morning, I will set off to start my volunteer jobs for the Summer, and development will most likely come halt for a bit.

Bye for now, I should get some rest.

New Bark Town is complete! The complex scripting in Oak's Lab has been finished after days of tests, and I am very excited for the future of this project.
You can now download **Public Test Builds** of the project over at the [dedicated Builds page.](https://github.com/Windexi/pwhyd/blob/master/BUILDS.md)
Starting this Saturday, development will start to slow down for the Summer, as my volunteer jobs will start full time. I'll submit another update on progress
before I leave.

Regards,

Hello, World! The project has been up for a few days now, and I thought it might be fitting to make a small page for blog entries of the game's development!
Currently, PWHYD is still very young. While I have been working nonstop, I've only scratched the surface of what the engine has to offer. I've done
a whole lot of rerouting, poking, and messing around with the code, and am starting to get the hang of things. Nevertheless, there are still things I am
totally clueless on. While I have been messing around with programming for as long as I can remember, Assembly and scripting for Pokemon games is still
relatively new to me. I've picked up on a lot of how the game seems to work, but still, being a second generation Pokemon game, the game is still a mess
of code and scripts jumbled together in the form of .ASM files. 

Making a ROM hack is a daunting project. As of now, I have nearly completed all the scripting in the starter town, and am excited to move on to forming the 
rest of the story in the PWHYD alternate universe! While I have the space in this entry, I would also like to mention that **development during Summer 2018 will 
be nearly halted.** This is due to me volunteering at a Summer camp, which will take up most of my time. With the spare time I do have, I will try to open up Visual Studio 
and get a few things done! This may be the first and last update until sometime after August 2018. Even though this is a setback, I definitely will 
try to get commits in while I have the time.

Thanks for reading!
