# A few Frequently Asked Questions... answered!

##### Q: What makes PWHYD so special?
A: Nothing. There are hundreds of hacks of Pokémon games in existence. Why should you waste your time on this one? You shouldn't. Who ever heard of a Pokémon fan game where the main character is a complete failure? That's the worst idea I've ever heard. Why does this exist? Pokémon is about becoming the very _best_. Not about being the very _worst_! ...And why does everyone hate you so much? Is there a reason?

##### Q: Okay, Haha. Very funny. Bashing your own game is trendy now, I see. Be real with me though, what are the cool things about this ROM?
A: How about, a deranged Professor Oak with Alzheimer's and a speech impediment? A dad who cares more about being the Pokémon champion than raising his own kid? A mom who is more interested in shooting up than hanging around her worthless son who lives with some stranger named Vinny? Seriously, who is Vinny? He's just... there. I don't even think he's related to you!

##### Q: Alright, alright, alright... I get it. So is this game is SFW?
A: Oh, definitely not.

##### Q: Come on, there at least have to be new Pokémon or something.
A: Nope. Nothing.

##### Q: What about your rival? He/she must at least be challenging or enough of a douchebag to make you hate them.
A: Just because you asked that, I'm going to make the rival the nicest person in existence. Ah! Now I have another great idea...

##### Q: If you're such a loser, do you even get a Pokedex? Or... catch your first legendary? You're sucking all the fun out of Pokémon games!
A: Why are you still here?
